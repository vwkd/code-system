## Introduction

<!-- ?? -->

- expression based language: `if`, loops, blocks are expressions
- comparisons are deeply, e.g. strings, arrays

## Variables

variables point to area in memory
?? if writes to variable, changes variable to point to new address in memory or overwrites data at address in memory
function parameters are actually just variables, get assigned the function parameters

### Variables

can be shadowed
type is inferred ??
value can be computed expression ?? needs type then ??
can not be declared in any scope, e.g. global scope ??
snake case by convention

### Constants

can't be shadowed
type needs to be specified
value can only be constant expression, not computed
can be declared in any scope, including global scope
upper case by convention
