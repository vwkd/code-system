# Character



## Introduction

- scalar type
- Unicode character
- beware: Unicode character is not necessarily actual character, see Unicode ⚠️
- stored as UTF-32
- beware: only mentions fixed-width 4 bytes, but actual encoding doesn't matter since internal conversions ❗️
- can use in string and vice versa
- can think of `u32` without illegal numbers
- `char`
