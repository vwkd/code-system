### `usize`

- pointer-sized unsigned integer



## Pointer

- value is a memory address
- can follow the address to get another value, "dereferencing"
- "value of another value"
- can think of a pointing finger, a physical address, a page number in a book, a hypherlink, etc.
- can have pointers to pointers
- potential problems since underlying data can change underneath
