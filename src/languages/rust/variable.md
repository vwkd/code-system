## Introduction


## Mutability

- immutable by default, opt-in to mutability, not other way around
- deeply immutable, e.g. tuples, arrays, vectors, structs, etc.
- can't define only certain part of type mutable, only all or nothing, e.g. one field of struct
- can use `_` to ignore assignment, doesn't move value, e.g. in destructuring
