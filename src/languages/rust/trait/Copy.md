# Copy



## Introduction

- ability to deeply copy value implicitly
- can think of implicit `clone()`, but always deeply
- needs to implement `Clone`
- can derive
- can't reimplement, always simple bit-wise copy
- all primitive types implement it
- automatically implemented for primitive non-collection types
- automatically implemented for primitive collection types that contain only `Copy` types
- automatically imported because included in prelude
