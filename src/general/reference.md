## Introduction

- data type of location
- value is location of another value, usually memory address
- points to value
- can think of a pointing finger, a physical address, a page number in a book, a hypherlink, etc.
- can think of value of another value
- other value can be anything, can be on stack or heap
- itself stored on stack
- can dereference
- allows more performance, doesn't copy memory
- can have pointers to pointers
- potential problems since underlying data can change underneath
- also called pointer, sometimes means concrete implementation



## Dereferencing

- follow location to get to value
- get value that points to
?? follows the memory address in pointer to get to value



## Smart pointer

- algebraic data type that holds reference
- holds additional metadata
- provides additional capabilities
- as transparent as possible, like reference
- can think of better reference
- e.g. growable collection type



## Fat pointer

- reference
- holds additional metadata for completeness
- double the size of simple reference
